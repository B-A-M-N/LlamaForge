Abstract

Aim to develop and characterize ceramic coating on dental implants to accelerate the direct bone apposition; a bio-inert metal substrate can be transformed into a bioactive implant by hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating. This chapter provides an overview of the role of nanomaterial in bioimplant coating, different methods of deposition of HAp thin film, significance of structure and morphology of the coatings along with the various characterization techniques, biocompatible and other properties of the HAp coatings, modification in fabrication of HAp nanoparticles, and finally the problem that is inherent in such coatings and the way to overcome the difficulties. Moreover, various attempts to modify the existing methods of HAp coating and the search for newer coatings for the biomaterials to overcome the problems have been made in different laboratories, and some of these efforts have been included in a critical manner. It is expected that the basic information of this chapter will help the future researcher to accelerate the works and innovative findings in the concerned field of nano-HAp coating on dental implants.

1. Introduction

Hydroxyapatite has a long and interesting history. Hydroxyapatite is derived from a larger group of calcium phosphate compounds, apatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH, F, Cl, Br)2], and the word came out from the Greek "apatan" which means to deceive. German geologist Abraham Werner was the first to use the word "apatite" for fluorapatite [1]. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is defined as a white crystalline powder that occurs naturally as an inorganic constituent of bone and teeth [2]. This mineral is the most stable form of calcium apatite and is chemically similar to the mineral component of bones and hard tissues in mammals [3]. HAp is stable and easily biointegrable. Among the calcium phosphate family, β-tricalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, and amorphous calcium phosphate [4] have been utilized for bone grafting and tissue engineering applications, and HAp has acquired a reputation as being the most stable, rigid, and compatible. The wide application of HAp in implant coating is due to the chemical and structural similarity with bone and teeth. Besides, the bioactivity of this biomaterial attracts medical and dental implants. A possible enhancement of bone formation has been reported compared to bio-inert implants due to bioactive nature of this ceramic [5, 6]. The excellent biological property, non-immunogenic, non-toxic nature, structural similarity with bone, and teeth minerals are the reasons that made HAp an outstanding material in biomedicine and biomaterial science. HAp has gained attention from basic scientists and technologists, and during the last three decades, large numbers of research works have been done focused on its synthesis and properties, evaluation, and applications. The availability of natural sources in plenty makes it prospective for use in large-scale applications in drug delivery, biomaterial coating, chemical sensors, etc. [7, 8]. A thin coating of HAp on metallic implants enhances the integration of bone and implant. The bonding of HAp with bone takes place immediately after implantation in the living body, and thus, HAp has been found to have excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity [7]. It is noteworthy that, though HAp has an excellent affinity to the bone, it lacks mechanical integrity, mainly low fracture toughness, poor tensile strength, and low crack resistance [9, 10]. These limitations have been successfully overcome by combining the beneficial properties of bioactive materials with adequate mechanical properties of metals. HAp does not induce toxicity or inflammatory and immune response, and the biodegradation products can be easily absorbed by surrounding tissues [11]. Various other properties of HAp, such as its biocompatibility, biodegradation, and nontoxicity, make HAp particularly attractive in the emerging field of synthetic bone, root canal filling, and joint replacement in orthopedics and dentistry [12, 13, 14].
